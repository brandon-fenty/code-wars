## Pair Kata 6-5-18 - my head is at the wrong end

Link: https://www.codewars.com/kata/56f699cd9400f5b7d8000b55

### Problem Domain: 

You're at the zoo... all the meerkats look weird. Something has gone terribly wrong - someone has gone and switched their heads and tails around!

Save the animals by switching them back. You will be given an array which will have three values (tail, body, head). It is your job to re-arrange the array so that the animal is the right way round (head, body, tail).

Same goes for all the other arrays/lists that you will get in the tests: you have to change the element positions with the same exact logics - simples!

## Pair Kata 6-6-18 - insert dashes

### Problem Domain: 

Write a function insertDash(num)/InsertDash(int num) that will insert dashes ('-') between each two odd numbers in num. For example: if num is 454793 the output should be 4547-9-3. Don't count zero as an odd number.

## Pair Kata 6-7-18 - Simple validation of a username with regex

 - https://www.codewars.com/kata/59cfc000aeb2844d16000075/solutions/javascript

### Problem Domains

 1. Regex Validate Pin Code: 
    - ATM machines allow 4 or 6 digit PIN codes and PIN codes cannot contain anything but exactly 4 digits or exactly 6 digits.

    If the function is passed a valid PIN string, return true, else return false.

2. Alternate capitalization:
    - Given a string, capitalize the letters that occupy even indexes and odd indexes separately, and return as shown below. Index 0 will be considered even.

    For example, capitalize("abcdef") = ['AbCdEf', 'aBcDeF']. See test cases for more examples.

    The input will be a lowercase string with no spaces.


## Pair Kata 6-11-18 - Nice Array

### NOTE: I was sick and not at school this day, I did not contribute to my partners whiteboarding for the challenge but we came up with similar solutions so I used her whiteboard solution instead of writing out a completely new one.

Link: https://www.codewars.com/kata/nice-array/train/javascript

Problem Domain: A Nice array is defined to be an array where for every value n in the array, there is also an element n-1 or n+1 in the array.

example:

[2,10,9,3] is Nice array because

2=3-1
10=9+1
3=2+1
9=10-1
Write a function named isNice/IsNice that returns true if its array argument is a Nice array, else false. You should also return false if input array has no elements.

## Pair Kata 6-12-18

Link: https://www.codewars.com/kata/disemvowel-trolls/javascript

Problem domain: Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.
